## How to Use

1. **Adding Tasks:** Type your task into the input field at the top and press "Add Task".
2. **Deleting Tasks:** Click on a task in the list and press "Delete Task" to remove it.
3. **Saving and Loading:** Use the "Save List" and "Load List" buttons to manage your tasks across sessions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/855princekumar/todo-list-python-gui.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd todo-list-python-gui
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
python todo_list.py
```

## Convert to Executable

You can convert the Python code into an executable (.exe) file for easier distribution using `pyinstaller`. Follow these steps:

1. Ensure `pyinstaller` is installed:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

2. Navigate to the directory containing your Python script (`todo_list.py`) in the command prompt or terminal.

3. Run the following command to create the executable:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile todo_list.py
```

This command will create a `dist` directory containing the executable file. The `--onefile` flag bundles everything into a single executable file.
