# py-to-do

Welcome to the py-to-do repository! üìù‚ú®

## Overview

This repository contains a simple To-Do List web application built using **PHP**, **Python**, **JSON**, and **AJAX** for task management. The app allows users to add and delete tasks, and the task list is saved persistently without refreshing the page.

## Tech Stack

- **PHP:** Used for the frontend to handle user inputs and requests. It processes form submissions and interacts with the backend Python script.
- **Python:** Handles backend logic, processing task management requests, and updates a **JSON** file to store the tasks.
- **JSON:** Used as a lightweight data format to store the task list, allowing persistence across page reloads.
- **AJAX:** Ensures smooth task updates without the need for a page refresh, providing a seamless user experience.

### How It Works

- The **PHP** frontend manages the user interface and handles form submissions. It sends task management requests (add or delete tasks) to the **Python** script.
- The **Python** script processes these requests by reading and modifying the **JSON** file, ensuring that tasks persist even after page reloads.
- **AJAX** enables dynamic task updates by exchanging data in **JSON** format, avoiding the need to reload the page and making the experience more responsive and efficient.

### Advantages:

- Efficient task handling with minimal server load.
- Real-time task updates without page refresh.
- Data persistence with JSON-based storage for easy scalability.
- Seamless integration of frontend and backend using PHP and Python.
- AJAX ensures a smooth, user-friendly experience.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Quickly add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks from the list with a click.
- **Persistent Storage:** Task data is saved across page reloads using Python and JSON.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Enjoy a clean and intuitive interface.

## How to Use

1. **Adding Tasks:** Type your task into the input field at the top and press "Add".
2. **Deleting Tasks:** Click on a task in the list and press "Delete" to remove it.
3. The task list will update dynamically without refreshing the page.
